# Files Provider

This plugin acts as composer plugin in order to provide files in a installation
aware manner. This means, that it searches in a configured boilerplate folder
structure in a defined order for files, based on installation placeholders. To
see how this works see corresponding section.

The behaviour of this plugin can be influenced by configuration in the `extra`
section of the root `composer.json`. See section `options` for available options.
